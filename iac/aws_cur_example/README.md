# AWS CUR to S3 + Athena (Example)

This is an example-only Terraform configuration showing the common “CUR → S3 → Athena” pattern.

Notes:
- The local demo in this repo does **not** require any AWS credentials.
- In a real engagement, I would align naming/tagging with an organization-wide standard and route CUR through a centralized payer account.
