# GCP Billing Export to BigQuery (Example)

This is an example-only Terraform configuration to scaffold a BigQuery dataset/table for billing exports.

Notes:
- Enabling billing export often includes console-side steps and org/policy constraints.
- The local demo in this repo does **not** require any GCP credentials.
